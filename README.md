# Java Basics

This contains simple Java programs to practice fundamental concepts.

## Files
- [Print.java](./Print.java) – Demonstrates printing with `System.out.print`, `System.out.println` and use of `\n`.
- [Variables.java](./Variables.java) – Shows how to declare and use primitive types (`int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`) and `String`.
- [UserInput.java](./UserInput.java) - User input with `Scanner` that handles different types of variables (refer from the previous java file) and calculating the area of a rectangle.
- [MadLibsGame.java](./MadLibsGame.java) - Another use for `Scanner` where user inputs noun, verbs and adjective and the output will be funny, unexpected, or perhaps nonsense.
- [ArithmeticOperators.java](./ArithmeticOperators.java) - This might trigger some math ptsd of some sort to you, but if you're seeing this in GitHub, perhaps you already made some resistance to it and the fact that you're exploring here is feat in itself. This shows how to use arithmetic operators in way of the math, it uses +, -, *, /, and %. The last one is modulus not percentage, it also showcases how PEMDAS works (Parenthesis - Exponent - Multiplication - Division - Addition - Subtraction)
- Soon to add... (I hope it's daily)

I learned Java by following [Bro Code’s Java Full Course for free ☕ (2025)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTtL8E4LzTQ).  
There are many tutorial or educational material out there, I just happened to see this one and decided to all in.
