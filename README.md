# Java Basics

This contains simple Java programs to practice fundamental concepts.

## Files
- [Print.java](./Print.java) – Demonstrates printing with `System.out.print`, `System.out.println` and use of `\n`.
- [Variables.java](./Variables.java) – Shows how to declare and use primitive types (`int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`) and `String`.
- [UserInput.java](./UserInput.java) - User input with `Scanner` that handles different types of variables (refer from the previous java file) and calculating the area of a rectangle.
- [MadLibsGame.java](./MadLibsGame.java) - Another use for `Scanner` where user inputs noun, verbs and adjective and the output will be funny, unexpected, or perhaps nonsense.
- [ArithmeticOperators.java](./ArithmeticOperators.java) - This shows how to use arithmetic operators in way of the math, it uses +, -, *, /, and %. The last one is modulus not percentage, it also showcases how PEMDAS works (Parenthesis - Exponent - Multiplication - Division - Addition - Subtraction)
- [ShoppingCartProgram.java](./ShoppingCartProgram.java) - This is basic shopping cart program. User input of item to buy, and price and quantity of the item by using `Scanner`.
- [IfStatments.java](./IfStatements.java) - Ask you of your name, age and student status, ofcourse you don't need to put your real information. It shows output of your status related to the user input. There's also emoji in output, but it might not show in your output if not compatible or UTF-8 encoding.
- [RandomNumbers.java](./RandomNumbers.java) - It is random generator of between x and y numbers. Can also be used to random a boolean outputs.
- [MathClass.java](./MathClass.java) - Demonstrates common `Math` functions such as `Math.pow()` for exponents and `Math.sqrt()` for square roots. It applies these functions to solve practical problems like calculating the area of a rectangle and the circumference of a circle.
- [PrintfFormatting.java](./PrintfFormatting.java) - The `printf()` is used to format an output. It covers speccifiers for different kind of variables such as strings, characters, integers, doubles and booleans. It also have flags, width, precision and padding options. Seeing is believing so just click the link `PrintfFormatting.java` in this section of note to redirect you to a bunch of examples.

- Soon to add... (I hope it's daily)

I learned Java by following [Bro Code’s Java Full Course for free ☕ (2025)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTtL8E4LzTQ).  
There are many tutorial or educational material out there, I just happened to see this one and decided to all in.
